# learn_at_home

## Goals

First off, let me tell you that I am bad at coding. I wanted a good way to learn how to code ( The correct way and not copy pasta ) without ever leaving my terminal.

The goal of this project is to make a nvim plugin where inside of it you do all of the 'code camp' things, but without those ugly browser editors, and all of the AI shoved in your face.

That being said, we have established that I am bad at coding, so I am going to be using AI to create this project.
